# Work Day Scheduler

The scheduler was developed with following criteria:

- There are time blocks for each hour of the day from 9am-5pm
- Each time block is color coded to indicate  whether the event is in the past, present, or future
- When the save button is clicked for specific time block the text entered is stored in local storage
